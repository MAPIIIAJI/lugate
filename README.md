## About
When we talk about Microservices Architecture pattern there is a thing there called
[API Gateway](http://microservices.io/patterns/apigateway.html) which is the single entry point into the system.


Lugate is a binding over OpenResty's [ngx\_http\_lua\_module](https://github.com/openresty/lua-nginx-module) module.
The library provides features for request parsing, validating and routing. Lugate acts like a caching proxy over the
JSON-RPC 2.0 protocol and is meant to be used like an entry point for your application.

## Install
Lugate can be installed via the luarocks package manager. Just run:
```bash
luarocks install lugate
```

## Synopsis
```lua
    location / {
          # MIME type determined by default_type:
          default_type 'application/json';

          content_by_lua_block {
              -- Load lugate module
              local Lugate = require "lugate"

              -- Get new lugate instance
                  local lugate = Lugate:init({
                    json = require "rapidjson",
                    ngx = ngx,
                    cache = {'redis', '127.0.0.1', 6379},
                    routes = {
                      ['v1%.([^%.]+).*'] = '/v1/%1', -- v1.math.subtract -> /v1/math
                      ['v2%.([^%.]+).*'] = '/v2/%1', -- v2.math.addition -> /v2/math
                    }
                  })

              -- Send multi requst and get multi response
              lugate:run()

              -- Print responses out
              lugate:print_responses()
          }
    }
```

## Lugate proxy call
Lugate brings its own protocol to live. It's goal is transferring, routing and distributing cache control logic over
JSON-RPC 2.0 request.

The *params* member of the [request object](http://www.jsonrpc.org/specification#request_object)
is wrapped in additional structure:

* **route** - The routing destination
* **params** - The original parameters member value should be moved here for now
* **cache** - Cache control logic
  * **ttl** - Cache time to life
  * **key** - Cache key

When the request is processed by the lugate proxy, the **route** and **cache** values are removed from the
*params* member and the nested **params** value is expanded to fill the whole parent *params* field.

The request routing plan:

- Request is preprocessed by the the lugate proxy. Location: gateway.lugate.loc:
```json
{"jsonrpc": "2.0", "method": "subtract", "params": {"cache":3600, "key": "foobar", "route": "v2.substract", "params": [42, 23]}, "id": 1}
```

- Request is send to the proper service (deciding of the `route` param). Location: /v2/substract:
```json
{"jsonrpc": "2.0", "method": "substract", "params": [42, 23], "id": 1}
```

- Request is sent back to client:
```json
{"jsonrpc": "2.0", "result": -19, "id": 2}
```

### Route
  The routing destination. The value is processed by the lua [gsub](http://www.lua.org/pil/20.1.html) function.
### Params
  The original params values.
### Ttl
  The time-to-life value is used to set cache expiration time. If ttl is false, no cache is set.
### Key
  The cache key is calculated by client. This approach gives more flexibility for debugging and development goals.

## API reference
To get the API reference use this [autogenerated doc](http://zinovyev.github.io/lugate).

## Testing
Use `busted` framework for running tests.

## Running example
The example project uses vagrant provision.
So you need to have vagrant and virtualbox installed on your PC.
Launch project by running this command from the example directory:
```bash
vagrant up
```
Add this line to your local `/etc/hosts` file:
```
192.168.50.47 gateway.lugate.loc service01.lugate.loc service02.lugate.loc service03.lugate.loc
```
